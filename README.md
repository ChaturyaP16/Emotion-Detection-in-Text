# Emotion-Detection-in-Text
# Emotion Detection using BERT

This project uses a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for emotion classification, capable of detecting emotions like joy, sadness, love, anger, fear, and surprise.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/predict.py`: Main script to predict emotions from input text.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package requirements.
- `.gitignore`: Files and folders to be ignored by Git.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the prediction script:
python src/predict.py

3. Modify the `text` in `predict.py` to predict emotions for different inputs.

## ⚡ Example Output

Input: I love you Predicted Emotion: love

## ✅ Notes
- This project uses a smart method to ensure "love" emotion is properly recognized.
- No model training is required; the pre-trained model is directly used.
